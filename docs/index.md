## Why This Repository?

The AI industry has entered the **Agentic Era**. Building production-grade AI systems now requires mastering agents, tool use, MCP, memory, long-running workflows, coding agents, agent harnesses, evals, and safety — but the knowledge is scattered across OpenAI blogs, Anthropic engineering posts, SDK docs, cookbooks, and research papers.

This repository consolidates **179 curated resources** into one structured learning roadmap.

**The goal: Become a world-class Agentic Engineer.**

---

## How To Use This Handbook

Pick the path that matches your starting point:

- **New to agents:** follow the [Learning Roadmap](#learning-roadmap) from Phase 0 to Phase 6. Treat each `Read First`, `Then Read`, and `Build Exercise` as a checklist.
- **Already building LLM apps:** start at [Phase 2](#phase-2--mcp--tool-ecosystem) or [Phase 3](#phase-3--context-memory--skills), then fill gaps in agent loop, tool calling, evals, and production engineering.
- **Trying to build projects:** use the phase-level `Build Exercise` prompts, then branch into [Applied Practice Tracks](#applied-practice-tracks) for coding agents, security, code review, or SRE.
- **Looking for references:** jump to the [Full Reading Table](#full-reading-table). Read `P0` first, use `P1` for implementation detail, and keep `P2` as optional background.

## Learning Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Agent Loop From Scratch

If you treat Claude Code as a coding CLI, many capabilities can feel like magic: it reads files, runs commands, edits code, delegates work, and stays oriented during complex tasks.

From an engineering perspective, the core is much simpler:

**model + tools + one loop.**

Understanding that loop makes the rest of the system easier to reason about:

- When the agent should plan first, and when it should act immediately
- Why an explicit todo list reduces drift in longer tasks
- Why subagents improve exploration while protecting the main context
- How skills, MCP, and hooks each add capability around the same core loop

These pages are based on the upstream English Markdown tutorials from [shareAI-lab/mini-claude-code](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/mini-claude-code), with added Study Notes and inline source code for this handbook.

| Step | Page | Code |
|------|------|------|
| v0 | [Bash is All You Need](tutorials/agent-loop/v0-bash-is-all-you-need.md) | [v0_bash_agent.py](tutorials/agent-loop/v0_bash_agent.py) |
| v1 | [Model as Agent](tutorials/agent-loop/v1-model-as-agent.md) | [v1_basic_agent.py](tutorials/agent-loop/v1_basic_agent.py) |
| v2 | [Structured Planning](tutorials/agent-loop/v2-structured-planning.md) | [v2_todo_agent.py](tutorials/agent-loop/v2_todo_agent.py) |
| v3 | [Subagent Mechanism](tutorials/agent-loop/v3-subagent-mechanism.md) | [v3_subagent.py](tutorials/agent-loop/v3_subagent.py) |
| v4 | [Skills Mechanism](tutorials/agent-loop/v4-skills-mechanism.md) | [v4_skills_agent.py](tutorials/agent-loop/v4_skills_agent.py) |

Supporting files are included in the same folder: `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `v0_bash_agent_mini.py`, and `skills/`.

**Next reference:** [minion.py](https://github.com/Sentdex/minion/blob/master/minion.py) is a compact, single-file coding agent worth reading after this lab. It shows how an OpenAI-compatible agent loop grows to include tool calls, sessions, resume, approvals, memory, and context compaction.

### Phase 1 — Agent Foundations

> Build shared vocabulary for workflow vs agent, tool loop, handoff, guardrails.

#### Key Mental Models

**Should I build an agent?** (4-question checklist from Barry Zhang's talk - Anthropic)

| Question | If No → Workflow | If Yes → Agent |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Is the task complex enough? | Decision tree is fully mappable | Ambiguous problem space |
| Is the task valuable enough? | <$0.10 per run | >$1 per run, cost doesn't matter |
| Are all core capabilities doable? | Weak links break the chain | Model handles every step well |
| Is error cost low & detectable? | High cost + hard to detect → human-in-the-loop | Errors caught by tests/CI |

**Think like the agent.** Most failures come from designing with a human perspective. Put yourself inside the agent's context window: you only see ~10K–20K tokens (system prompt + tool descriptions + recent observations). Ask: does the agent have enough information to act correctly at each step?
